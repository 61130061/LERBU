## Basic

This design is simple and rich which is similar to IOS switch. 
The corner of the switch can be easily modified by changing `rounded-full` class in `div` tag.
This component is desiged with the theme color that work on both `light` and `dark` mode with `dark:` class of tailwind.
However, if you want to seperate it with `dark:` class, it would work without breaking the component as well.
